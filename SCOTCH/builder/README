The SCOTCH builder is a collection of Makefiles and scripts to build the required flavours
of the SCOTCH libraries.

The easiest way to build the library for a given platform is to use the build_all.sh
script provided.

This checks for a scotch_VERSION.tar.gz archive in this folder, and runs MAKE for all the
platform-specific MPI flavours.

For example, running:

bash ./build_all.sh win64

when a file scotch_6.0.5rc3.tar.gz is present will build SCOTCH for MPICH, MSMPI, and
IMPI.

The steps are as follows:

1) Extract the archive to scotch_<VERSION>_<PLAT_NAME>_<COMMLIB>_source and build.
2) Copy the include files and libraries to:
    ../<VERSION>/<PLAT_NAME>/include
    ../<VERSION>/<PLAT_NAME>/lib/
    ../<VERSION>/<PLAT_NAME>/lib/<COMMLIB>/

   Note that only the sequential libraries are copied to <PLAT_NAME>/lib/ and the
   parallel libraries to <PLAT_NAME>/lib/<COMMLIB>/


For Windows builds, there are a set of dummy includes for <strings.h> and <sys/time.h>
which are used in some of the SCOTCH source files without checking for platform support.
There is also a compiler/linker driver implemented in winwrap.go. This tool is compiled
to and executable, and requires the Go compiler to be installed.
